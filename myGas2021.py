#
#   Description     |   A program to read electrode responses from an Alphasense AFE through the
#                       South Coast SCience DFE via a Raspberry Pi4.
#
#   Comments        |   This version is functionally correctly.  Try loops with error handling
#                       for connection errors have been included.
#                       
#                       Version 1.0 : This is an update to Gas.py and Gas2.py but convberted to a single
#                       script.  The c# calling program has been rewritten such that the same
#                       function calls multiple python scripts and handles the output based
#                       on the returned data.

#   Import necessary libraries.

# set in the calling program and passed to this script as sys.argv[1]. We take electrode readings at
